# ComfyUI-Utils-extra
A compact collection of utility nodes for **ComfyUI** that I could not find in other node packs, but which I need in my production workflow.  
They help automate repetitive tasks, relay group states, manage sampler parameters, and simplify work with lists.

This repository will be gradually expanded with new practical utilities.

# Nodes Overview

---

## Index Multiple
**Category:** `utils/list`  
**Class:** `IndexMultiple`

Extracts a specific range from any **List** or **Batch** (images, masks, latents, text — any type) and creates individual outputs for that range.  
Optionally replaces missing values with a fallback (`if_none`).

<details>
<summary><b>Show detailed explanation & examples</b></summary>

### How it works
1. Connect any List/Batch to `input_any`.
2. Set:
   - `starting_index` — the first index to output  
   - `length` — how many elements to output
3. Outputs are generated as `item_0 … item_49`.  
   Only the first `length` outputs are meaningful.

### Example 1 — simple extraction
Input:  
`[mask_0, mask_1, mask_2, mask_3, mask_4]`

Settings:
- `starting_index = 3`
- `length = 2`

Result:
- `item_0 = mask_3`
- `item_1 = mask_4`

### Example 2 — unknown list length + fallback
If you ask for 5 outputs but receive only 2 items, the rest become `None`, or `if_none` if connected.

## AKSampler Settings
**Category:** `utils/settings`  
**Class:** `AKSamplerSettings`

A minimalistic node that stores three key sampler parameters:

- `Seed`
- `Denoise`
- `Cfg`

It outputs them as a **LIST**, suitable for passing into:

- **AKSettings Out**
- any **SetNode**
- custom controller graphs

---

## AKSettings Out
**Category:** `utils/settings`  
**Class:** `AKSettingsOut`

Expands the LIST received from **AKSampler Settings** into three independent outputs:

- `Seed`
- `Denoise`
- `Cfg`

Useful for distributing sampler parameters across multiple samplers or exposing them deeper into the graph.

---

## IsOneOfGroupsActive
**Category:** `utils/logic`  
**Class:** `IsOneOfGroupsActive`

Checks the state of all groups whose names **contain a specified substring**.  
If **at least one** matching group is Active -> output is `true`.  
If **all** matching groups are Muted/Bypassed -> output is `false`.

<details>
<summary><b>More details</b></summary>

- Matching is substring-based.  
  Example: `"Face"` matches `FaceFix`, `FaceDetail`, `Faces`, etc.
- If no matching groups are found -> output = `false`.

</details>

---

## RepeatGroupState
**Category:** `utils/logic`  
**Class:** `RepeatGroupState`

A connection-free node that synchronizes the state of its own group with the state of other groups matching a given substring.

Logic:

1. Finds groups with names containing the target substring.
2. Checks whether any of them are Active.
3. If **all** matching groups are disabled -> it disables **its own group**.
4. If **any** matching group is active -> it enables **its own group**.

This allows groups to depend on other groups without wires, similar to rgthree repeaters.

<details>
<summary><b>Usage examples</b></summary>

### Example 1 — enable your group if “MainFix” is active
Filter: `MainFix`  
If any "MainFix*" group is Active -> enable the current group.

### Example 2 — auto-disable helper groups
Filter: `Hands`  
If all hand-related groups are muted -> disable current group too.
